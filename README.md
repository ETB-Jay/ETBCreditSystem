# ETB Credit System
A Credit System designed by Michael Zhang using React.js, Electron.js, and tailwindcss.

[Firebase (Firestore)](https://firebase.google.com/) is used as the backend for this project.

# FEATURES AND USAGE
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/835b59c0-2b57-47c2-a291-ac69233d9349)

**1 - Search Bar** Filters by first AND last name, but NOT by email.

**2 - '+' Icon** Adds a new customer to the system. 

**3 - Information Icon** Displays a log containing the current number of users, total credit in the system, and the number of outstanding balances.

**4 - Filter Icon** Filters the transactions. Includes filters for date, amount transfered, and the employee's name. 

**5 - Triple Dot Icon** Allows the user to choose between adding a new transaction OR editing the current user's information

## Other Notes
- The transaction list is sorted by date (most recent at the top)
- A customer with an outstanding balance will have a warning symbol next to their name in the customer list and their balance.
- `CTRL + R` reloads the app display. This command is useful when the app needs to be reloaded to access new data inputted directly into firestore or from another device with the credit system.

## Getting Logs
The Report contains a download button that allows the user to download a zip file containing two csv files with the customers and transactions. 

**NOTE:** This format is different from what is displayed in Firebase (since it is a NoSQL, nonrelational database instead of a SQL, relational database). As a result, it cannot be directly plugged into the Firebase database and will require seperate code to change the `.csv` format to a `.json`. See [https://github.com/ETB-Jay/ETBCreditLogs](https://github.com/ETB-Jay/ETBCreditLogs) for how to upload credit logs from a different system to Firestore. 

# DOWNLOAD
1. Open the 'Releases' Tab on the right and download `ETBCredit-Setup-<version>.exe`
2. If necessary, allow permissions to install the `.exe` (I promise this app is secure ðŸ˜Š)

# UPDATES AND BUG FIXING
From 2025-05-05 to 2025-08-29, I will be conducting preliminary updates and bug fixing as the store gets used to the system. Please ask either Jay or Kris to get my contact information if you have questions or have noticed any bugs.

After this period (post my co-op), I will be copying the source files to a different computer but will keep a copy for myself. If you would like to know more about the source material OR need information that I have not uploaded to github (i.e. Enviornment Variables, API keys), then you can contact Jay or Kris to get my contact information. Please do not hesitate to ask me if you have questions about the code. I am also open to doing bug fixes while I am away and back at school.
